# ChatGPT Open-Source 1.0

**ChatGPT Open-Source 1.0** is an open-source, web-based AI chat interface that connects directly to a privately hosted API running an open-weight language model.

The frontend is fully static and runs in the browser.  
All AI inference is performed by the API you host and control.

## Features

  Built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks or build steps required.

  User messages are sent directly to the API, and model replies are displayed instantly.
