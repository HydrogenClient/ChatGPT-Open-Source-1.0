# ChatGPT Open-Source 1.0

**ChatGPT Open-Source 1.0** is an open-source, web-based AI chat interface that connects directly to a privately hosted API running an open-weight language model.

The frontend is fully static and runs in the browser.  
All AI inference is performed by the API you host and control.

## Hosted API

A live instance of the AI API is available at:

[ChatGPT Open-Source 1.0 API on Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CooLLaMACEO/ChatGPTOpenSource1.0)

This allows you to try the interface without setting up your own API.  
The backend is fully open-source, so you can inspect, modify, or host it yourself.

## Features

- ✅ **Static web frontend**  
  Built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks or build steps required.

- ✅ **No paid APIs**  
  Does not rely on OpenAI or other paid inference services.

- ✅ **Real-time responses**  
  User messages are sent directly to the API, and model replies are displayed instantly.

- ⚠️ **No conversation memory (yet)**  
  Each message is processed independently.
